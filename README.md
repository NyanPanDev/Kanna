# Notes


<b>Note:</b> I planned to work on this project for about 2 months, therefore I kept the scope small and manageable so a lot of QOL features are missing. This is meant as a prototype and a test of abilities in handling a new tech stack. Safe to say that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript now.
